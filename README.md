# Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-Mindset
Problem Statement: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing: - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0) - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).  You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
